{"name":"Bwd","tagline":"Big White Duck","body":"### Big White Duck Resources.\r\nThis will be the home for help and information for the BWD Pro Stacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pro Stacks for Pro Users\r\nThe BWD Pro Stacks are not for everyone. If however you consider yourself a power user then you may be interested.\r\n\r\nPro Stacks often require a detailed knowledge of RapidWeaver and sometimes require other experience as well. In order to leverage the power that hand coding brings but within a stack, you will often need to know the basis of what you are trying to achieve. Sometimes this may involve CSS, other times related technologies such as Font handling or base64 encoding.\r\n\r\n### The Members Site\r\nAdmission to the BWD members site is by invitation only. This is the only way to access BWD pro stacks.\r\n\r\nAny member who shares Pro Stacks with non-members will face immediate expulsion. Sorry if this is draconian but otherwise the whole exercise is pointless.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPro Stack support is limited to members of the Duck-Me members group? Check out our [documentation](https://atavernor.github.io/bwd) or contact members support and weâ€™ll help you sort it out. Please do not use the public BWD support channel for issues concerning Pro Stacks.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
